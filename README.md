This project is a simple Employee Payroll System developed using Java with a focus on core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles such as Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction.

 
 ## Features ##

 Add employee details (ID, name, role, salary, etc.)

 Calculate monthly and annual salary

 Generate simple payroll reports

 Different employee types (e.g., Full-Time, Part-Time,) using inheritance

 Modular, readable, and maintainable code using OOP design

## OOP Concepts Used ##

1. Encapsulation
Each class encapsulates its data and exposes only necessary information through getter and setter methods.

2. Inheritance
A base Employee class is extended by specific types like FullTimeEmployee, PartTimeEmployee, and Intern.

3. Polymorphism
Payroll calculation is handled polymorphically by overriding methods in child classes.

4. Abstraction
Abstract classes and interfaces define common behavior for all types of employees.
